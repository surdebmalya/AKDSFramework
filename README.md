AKDSFramework is a Purely written in Python library containing implementations of various data structures.

Our Package will allow user to focus on developing algorithms and not worry about finding python-compatible implementations of classic data structures like linked list, heap and others.

# Useful links
- **Documentation** We've written a comprehensive documentation for our framework AKDSFramework. Have a look at it [here](https://github.iamroyakash.com/AKDSFramework-docs) and a read-the-docs version is also available [here](https://akdsframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- See what's in the **works** now [here](https://www.notion.so/theroyakash/8a9998cb8b7f4d318e05dfce28fbcfda?v=b8c3cf3084a8426394f7307a2005c945).

## Setup
- First download/clone this repo like git clone `https://github.com/theroyakash/AKDSFramework.git`
- Now uninstall if any previous version installed `pip3 uninstall AKDSFramework`
- Now install fresh on your machine `pip3 install -e AKDSFramework`

### Alternate installation
This is easier to install but a bit slower in the installation time.
`pip3 install https://github.com/theroyakash/AKDPRFramework/tarball/main`

## First code, Check the version
Now to check whether your installation is completed without error import AKDSFramework
```python
import AKDSFramework
print('AKDSFramework Version is --> ' + AKDSFramework.__version__)
```
## Example code creating Linked List
```python
from AKDSFramework.structure.linkedlist import SinglyLinkedList

lkl = SinglyLinkedList()
# Now add some data into it
lkl.add(20)
lkl.add(120)
lkl.add(7102)
lkl.add(773)

# Now to see your linked list
print(lkl)   # ---> 20 --> 120 --> 7102 --> 773 --> None
# Now reverse this linked list:
print(reversed(lkl))
```
